                I chose to pursue a career in Front-End development because I have always had a natural skill with computers and programming, along with a creative side that I enjoy applying to my work. Right now, I'm focused on my studies and freelance projects to grow my skills, but I'm looking forward to starting a professional career at a company soon.</p>
