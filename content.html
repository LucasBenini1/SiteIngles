                    Digital security is an increasingly important topic, as the number of virtual threats and hacking
                    attempts continues to grow. Whether it’s to protect personal information, financial data, or
                    simply maintain privacy, investing in digital security practices is essential. In this article, we’ll
                    cover some tips and best practices to protect yourself and your information online. <br>
                <div class="itens">
                    1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords <br><br>
                    • Use complex passwords that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
                    symbols.<br>
                    • Avoid obvious passwords, such as “123456” or “password123”.<br>
                    • Each account should have a unique password. This prevents a hack on one platform from
                    compromising other accounts.<br> <br>
                    2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)<br><br>
                    • Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to
                    confirm your identity. • 2FA can be configured via SMS, authentication apps (such as Google
                    Authenticator) or biometric authentication, making it difficult for unauthorized people to
                    access your account.<br><br>
                    3. Beware of Suspicious Emails and Links<br><br>
                    • Phishing attacks are common and involve fake emails that appear legitimate but are intended
                    to steal your information.<br>
                    • Before clicking on links or downloading files, check the sender and be wary of messages that
                    ask for urgent personal or financial information.<br><br>
                    4. Keep Your Devices and Software Up to Date.<br><br>
                    • System and software updates often include security fixes for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

                    5. Use Secure Network Connections.<br><br>
                    • Avoid accessing sensitive accounts, such as banking or email, on public and open Wi-Fi
                    networks, which are vulnerable to interception.<br>
                    • Whenever possible, use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to protect your browsing, especially
                    on open networks.<br><br>
                    6. Be Careful When Sharing Personal Information.<br> <br>
                    • Minimize the exposure of personal information on social media and online platforms. The
                    less you expose, the less vulnerable you will be to scams.<br>
                    • Avoid sharing data such as your location, phone number, date of birth and other sensitive
                    information.<br> <br>
                    7. Be Wary of Unknown Applications and Software.<br> <br>
                    • Only download applications from trusted sources, such as official stores (Google Play Store,
                    Apple App Store).<br>
                    • Read the permissions requested by applications and avoid those that ask for access to data
                    unnecessary for their functionality.<br> <br>
                    8. Regularly Backup Your Data.<br> <br>
                    • Perform periodic backups of your important files on external devices or secure cloud services.<br>
                    • In the event of attacks such as ransomware (which blocks access to your data), having
                    updated backups makes it easier to recover information without paying ransoms.<br><br>
                    9. Use Antivirus and Firewall.<br><br>
                    • Even with all the precautions, it is essential to have good antivirus and firewall software to
                    protect your devices from threats.<br><br>
                    • Set your antivirus to perform automatic scans and update itself periodically.<br><br>
                    10. Continuously Educate Yourself on Digital Security.<br>
                    • Online threats are constantly evolving, so it’s important to stay up to date on new ways to
                    protect yourself.<br>
                    • Follow blogs, podcasts, and other digital security channels to learn current and advanced
                    practices.<br><br>
                    Conclusion:<br>
                    Adopting digital security practices does not guarantee absolute protection, but it significantly
                    reduces risks. With these tips, you can browse and interact online more safely, minimizing the
                    chances of privacy invasion or data theft. Protecting yourself digitally is an ongoing and

            <div class="unappear" id="appear3">
                <p> Virtual Reality: A Tool for Environmental Awareness and Preservation
                    Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that transports us to simulated and immersive
                    environments, allowing us to experience new worlds without leaving our seats. Initially, this
                    technology gained prominence in entertainment and games, but its applications go far beyond
                    that. Today, VR has been used in areas such as education, medicine, professional training and,
                    increasingly, as a powerful tool for environmental awareness.
                    Virtual Reality and Environmental Awareness
                    By relating VR to themes such as “Earth, Our Home” and “Caring for the Planet, Caring for
                    Ourselves,” we see how this technology can impact the way we view the environment. With
                    virtual reality, we can experience first-hand the impacts of human actions on the planet,
                    whether by simulating the degradation of ecosystems, the consequences of deforestation or
                    the effects of climate change. These simulations not only educate, but also provoke an
                    emotional response that makes environmental issues more real and urgent.
                    The immersion provided by VR can be a way to raise awareness about the need to protect the
                    Earth. When someone explores a virtual rainforest, watches glaciers melt, or feels the effects of
                    a virtual forest fire, these experiences are not only visual but also emotional, connecting
                    people deeply with the concept of “Earth, Our Home.” VR, therefore, makes the consequences
                    of destructive actions more tangible and helps cultivate a sense of responsibility.
                    Environmental Impact Simulations
                    Virtual reality can reproduce various environmental situations, allowing the user to better
                    understand the effects of climate change and pollution in a realistic and interactive way. For
                    example: <br><br>
                <div class="itens">
                    1. Ecosystem and Biodiversity Exploration: VR experiences can take the user inside a rainforest
                    or a coral reef, showing the importance of biodiversity and the threats these ecosystems face.
                    Exploring these virtual environments can teach about the role of each species and reinforce the
                    need to preserve them. <br><br>
                    2. Climate Change Simulations: VR allows users to visualize future projections of the planet if
                    global temperatures continue to rise. These simulations can visually demonstrate rising sea
                    levels, melting glaciers, and the effects on vulnerable communities, reinforcing the idea that
                    “Taking Care of the Planet, Taking Care of Us.” <br><br>
                    3. Immersive Experiences on Pollution and Plastic Consumption: Another use of VR is the
                    simulation of highly polluted areas or areas full of plastic waste in the oceans. This experience,
                    unlike traditional images, allows users to “walk” through trash or “swim” through a sea full of
                    plastic, providing a more visceral sense of the severity of pollution.
                    Environmental Education with Virtual Reality
                    Virtual reality has proven to be an effective ally in educational initiatives and environmental
                    awareness programs. Educational institutions, NGOs, and environmental organizations are
                    using technology to create experiences that help students and the public understand the
                    interdependence between the planet and humanity. These programs allow users to “live”
                    environmental impact and learn about sustainable practices such as recycling, water
                    conservation, and reducing the use of plastics.
                    By using VR for environmental education, we are preparing a new generation that sees the
                    planet as their home, understands the importance of each action in caring for the
                    environment, and is motivated to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives.
                    VR and Creating Solutions for the Future
                    Virtual reality is not only a tool for raising awareness, but also for innovation. Scientists and
                    environmentalists are using VR to simulate the impact of sustainable policies and practices on a
                    large scale, helping to predict the benefits of conservation and sustainability projects. Virtual
                    simulations allow us to test and visualize how implementing urban green spaces, preserving
                    forests, and transitioning to renewable energy can positively transform our relationship with
                    the planet.
                    Conclusion: Virtual Reality as a Path to Transformation
                    The power of VR goes beyond technology; it lies in its ability to connect people emotionally to
                    environmental issues. By allowing us to explore the Earth as if we were present in each place,
                    VR reinforces the idea that “Earth, Our Home” needs our protection and care. These immersive
                    experiences encourage responsibility and awareness, as they show that “Caring for the Planet,
                    Caring for Ourselves” is not just a slogan, but a necessity.
                    Virtual reality offers a new way of seeing the world and awakening the commitment in each of
                    us to care

                    Real-time data collection technologies are basically the first step towards the beginning of a smart city. Analyzes of this data help local governments improve the implementation of technology-based urban services, ranging from garbage collection to public transport management.
                    A practical example of this data collection is the “Moovit” application, functional in São Paulo and other large cities in Brazil. Based on the collection of data from the city's public transport, the application is capable of showing the user the fastest and most efficient bus route for a person to get from point A to point B. In addition to showing the user the intervals between buses and also possible delays.
                    This example demonstrates how data collection can directly influence the life of a city resident, directly (and positively) affecting their time management. Furthermore, the application influences more people to use public transport more, which leads to a small reduction in pollution levels.

                    Information and communication technology(ICT): <br>
                    Information and communications technology includes a range of data-related technologies. The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology defines ICT as a field that encompasses the capture, storage, retrieval, processing, display, representation, presentation, organization, administration, security, transfer, and exchange of data and information."

                    <h2 class="itemTitle">Internet of Things </h2><br>
                    Broadly speaking, the Internet of Things includes any object or “thing” that can be connected wirelessly to the Internet. Today, IoT more specifically refers to things that are connected and equipped with sensors, software and other technologies to transmit and receive data to inform users or automate actions. 
                    Traditionally, connectivity has been through Wi-Fi, but now 5G and other types of network platforms promise to process massive sets of data quickly and reliably almost anywhere.
                    When IoT devices collect and transmit data, the main concern is to learn as much as possible from them and make their results and insights more accurate and sophisticated. This is where AI technologies come into play: they complement IoT networks with the power of advanced analytics and machine learning.
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="itemTitle">Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h2><br>
                    Artificial intelligence combines computer science and powerful data sets to solve problems.
                    Smart city projects use artificial intelligence and machine learning-based solutions to manage infrastructure efficiently and sustainably. For example, AI algorithms can optimize garbage collection routes and reduce carbon emissions from urban garbage collection trucks.   
                    AI can also help law enforcement improve public safety by analyzing data from security cameras and connected devices to detect crimes.
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="itemTitle">Smart Energy </h2><br>
                    Smart city technology like AI can help energy providers manage smart grids, which are electrical grids equipped with sensors and software.
                    Currently, there are already advanced data analysis tools, based on AI, that can analyze the data provided by an energy company, to predict consumption patterns and anticipate future use, thus avoiding sudden power outages, helping in the fight against waste and also meeting customer needs more effectively.
                    Smart energy can also support the integration of renewable energy sources and more efficient technologies, helping to avoid climate change.
                    Smart energy technologies can also reduce CO2 emissions, waste and resource expenditure in oil and gas operations. Examples include:         
                    Perform predictive asset optimization through AI and IoT to extend asset life and reduce resources required to sustain and oversee assets.
                    Optimize upstream and midstream operations along with a focus on systemic asset performance. This approach helps you better plan your move to digital systems and investigate devices with low performance and excessive consumption.
                    The use of environmental monitoring technology to reduce energy consumption and improve health, safety and environmental issues.
                    Another practical application of smarter and more sustainable energy is in relation to electric vehicles, where the replacement of combustion-powered vehicles would significantly reduce carbon dioxide levels in the air. Currently, Tesla and the Chinese BYD are leaders in the production of electric vehicles.
                    Currently, in China's Zhejiang province, there are around one million electric vehicle charging stations.
